# **ByteRead** Official Article Submission Guide

*Guiding the next generation of analysis at the convergence of AI, Biology, and Medicine.*

---

## 1. ByteRead's Mission and Editorial Tone

**ByteRead** publishes concise, high-impact analysis focused exclusively on the strategic intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Biology/Neuroscience, and Medicine**. Our goal is to transform complex, foundational research into clear, accessible, and forward-looking reports for a professional audience.

### 1.1 Tone and Style Requirements
* **Analytic and Objective:** Avoid conversational or sensational language. The tone should be authoritative, evidence-based, and focused on translating scientific findings into strategic insights.
* **Clarity is King:** Simplify complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Define technical jargon clearly. Assume the reader is highly intelligent but not necessarily specialized in your narrow field.
* **Length:** Submissions are typically **800â€“1,500 words** (excluding citations). Conciseness is valued.

---

## 2. Article Structure and Content

All submissions must follow the standard journalistic structure, ensuring a smooth, logical flow from broad topic to specific conclusion.

### 2.1 Mandatory Structural Elements
* **Title:** Clear, engaging, and accurately reflecting the content (max 10 words).
* **Abstract/Summary Paragraph:** A single paragraph (max 150 words) placed before the main body, summarizing the core challenge, the research discussed, and the key takeaway.
* **Introduction:** Clearly define the domain and the "grand challenge" the article addresses. Set the stage for convergence.
* **Body Paragraphs:** Use H2 and H3 headings to logically divide the analysis (e.g., I. Computational Foundations, A. Autonomous Labs). Each section must be **analytical**, not purely descriptive.
* **Conclusion/Outlook:** Briefly summarize the findings and offer a strategic perspective on future research or policy implications. Do not introduce new concepts here.

### 2.2 Author and Metadata Submission
Authors must provide the following separate metadata upon submission:
1.  **Full Author Name(s):** Include current affiliation or primary professional role.
2.  **Short Biography:** A 50-word biography for each author.
3.  **Suggested Keywords:** Up to five keywords for search optimization (e.g., genomics, large language models, neuro-AI).

---

## 3. Sourcing and Citation Guidelines

**ByteRead** is committed to grounding its analysis in primary research and authoritative sources.

### 3.1 Citation Format
* Use in-text, bracketed numbers to reference your sources (e.g., [1], [2]).
* The list of sources should be titled **"Works Cited"** and placed at the end of the article.
* **MANDATORY:** Every citation must be a full, accessible web link (URI) to the original paper, press release, or report. Do not cite secondary news reports unless the primary source is inaccessible.

### 3.2 Example of a Correct Citation Entry

| Column | Content |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Correct Format** | [1] Title of Research Paper or Report, Author(s), Publication Journal/Source, Year. https://full-working-link-to-source.com/document |

---

## 4. Image and Multimedia Requirements

Images must serve an instructional purpose (e.g., charts, diagrams, or scientific illustrations) and adhere strictly to copyright law.

### 4.1 Image Link Guidelines
* **ByteRead** does not host image files directly from authors. You must provide a **direct, stable URL** for any external image you wish to include.
* **Do not use base64 data, local file paths, or private storage links.**
* All images must be accompanied by a descriptive **Caption** and a clear **Credit/Source** line.

---

## 5. Legal and Ethical Policy on Sources and Content

### 5.1 Plagiarism Policy
**Zero Tolerance:** **ByteRead** maintains a zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism. Plagiarism includes:
i.  Presenting someone else's work, ideas, or words as your own without proper attribution.
ii. Using copyrighted text without enclosing it in quotation marks and citing the source, or without securing explicit permission where required.

Any submission found to contain plagiarized material will be **rejected immediately** and the author may be banned from future submissions.

### 5.2 Copyright and Fair Use of Sources
Authors are solely responsible for ensuring that all materials submitted comply with copyright law.

* **Textual Content:** All text must be original or appropriately quoted and attributed. You must rely on **summarization and analysis** of sources, not wholesale reproduction.
* **Image Copyright (Crucial):** You **must** possess the necessary rights or licenses for every image linked. Acceptable sources are limited to:
    * (a) Images the author created and holds the copyright to.
    * (b) Images released under an explicit **Creative Commons (CC) license** (e.g., CC BY, CC BY-SA). The specific license must be noted in the Credit line.
    * (c) Images explicitly designated as **Public Domain**.
    * (d) Images used under legally sound **Fair Use / Fair Dealing** provisions (e.g., using a small, low-resolution thumbnail solely for non-commercial educational critique or analysis). **Note:** Reliance on Fair Use is subject to stringent editorial review and is discouraged for commercial or non-critical use.
* **Prohibited Use:** Content scraped from commercial websites, proprietary research databases, or private social media platforms without explicit permission is strictly prohibited.

---
*Submitting an article confirms the author's acceptance of and adherence to all policies detailed in this guide, including full responsibility for the originality and legal standing of all submitted content.*
